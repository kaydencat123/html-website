<h2> On the page i will tell you about the tera types, A tera type is when you use a Terasilization to change your type </h2>
<h3> Tera types change your Pokemon's type defensively, while keeping the offensive benefits of their original type. The best idea for using a tera type is to use it against a strong pokemons counter. And you get a 1.5x Damage boost for that type, If you tera type into the type you already are you get a 2x damage boost.</h3>
<h3> thats all you really need to know about tera types and if you want to see the super effective and weak types for teras you can check <a href="pokemontype.html"> Pokemon Types and Weaknesses</a> </h3>
